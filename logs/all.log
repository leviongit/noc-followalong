* INFO: You pressed CTRL+R which is a key combo reserved by DragonRuby.
Pressing CTRL+R invokes ~$gtk.reset_next_tick~ (safely resetting your game with a convenient key combo).

If you want to disable this behavior, add the following to the top of =main.rb=:

#+begin_src
  $gtk.disable_reset_via_ctrl_r

  def tick args
    ...
  end
#+end_src

NOTE: ~$gtk.disable_console~ will also disable the CTRL+R reset behavior.
